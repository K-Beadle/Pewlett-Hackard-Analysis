# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
  Determine how many people will be retiring and, of those employees, who is eligible for a retirement package.

## Results
  There are a large amount of Senior positions that are going to need to be filled very soon. The engineering department seems to be taking the largest hit with employees about to retire soon. It may be worth asking for clarification on the "Staff" title to figure out exactly what those employees do and which department they are a part of or if the title's were never properly entered into the system.
  
  - There are 90,000+ employees that are going to retire from the company soon.
  - Senior Engineers are the largest population that are among the retirees at 29,414.
  - Senior Staff are the second largest population among the retirees at 28,254.
  - Of the retiring population, only 1,549 are eligible for the mentorship program.
  - Only ~1.7% of the retiring population is eligible for the mentorship program which means they PH may need to seek additional efforts to ensure effective training of new employees.

## Summary
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
-- over 90,000 roles are going to need to be filled in the upcoming "Silver Tsunami".
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
-- No, there are not enough to achieve the best outcome for mentorship of the next generations. They may need to hire third party consultants. 

Pewlett Hackard should utilize the 1500+ employees eligible for mentorship and create a program for new generations to learn from them through digital content training. If all of the retirees were given projects to come up with their own mentorship program that can be taught to someone new through online presentations and training videos, that would be a great use of their time since they would not be able to mentor that many people individually. Implementing a program like this would allow future retirees to add to it and you would not need to keep them on payroll as long except for maybe whenever you want to bring them in for consulting purposes on large complex projects that would require specific expertise.
