# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
  Determine how many people will be retiring and, of those employees, who is eligible for a retirement package.

## Results
  There are a large amount of Senior positions that are going to need to be filled very soon. The engineering department seems to be taking the largest hit with employees about to retire soon. It may be worth asking for clarification on the "Staff" title to figure out exactly what those employees do and which department they are a part of or if the title's were never properly entered into the system.
